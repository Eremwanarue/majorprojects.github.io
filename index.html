									<h2><a href="#">Comprehensive Analysis of Road Traffic Accident<br /> </a></h2>
									<p>The task focused on analysing road traffic accident data to identify patterns, risk factors, and impacts, and 
										to develop recommendations for improving road safety. The tool used for this analysis was Microsoft Excel, which was employed to import, clean, 
										and standardize the dataset, apply filters for exploration, compute key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize results through dashboards. The findings revealed that road accidents occurred 
										more frequently in November and on Fridays, with urban areas being particularly affected due to higher traffic volumes associated with weekend activities. Based on these insights, the analysis recommended measures 
										such as enhanced traffic control at junctions, consistent illumination of traffic lights and roadside lighting, and regular road maintenance and debris removal. The study concluded that data-driven strategies can significantly aid in reducing accidents and improving public safety.<br />

										<h2><a href="#">FREELANCERGIG ECONOMY<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Freelancer Gig.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The task involved analysing freelancer data from multiple gig economy platforms to uncover trends in earnings, job success, and performance metrics. Tableau was the primary tool used, enabling data importation, cleaning, table joining, and visualization through interactive dashboards. The analysis explored key indicators such as earnings by job category, success rate by platform, and hourly rates across experience levels. Forecasting techniques were applied to predict future earnings trends. Findings revealed that specialized fields like graphic design and app development yielded higher pay,
										while experienced freelancers with strong client satisfaction records achieved higher rehire rates. The study recommended focusing on high-demand categories, enhancing client relationships, and leveraging forecasting insights for career planning. Ultimately, the Tableau dashboards provided clear, data-driven intelligence to support freelancers, businesses, and policymakers in optimizing performance within the growing gig economy.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Customer behaviour.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The situation involved Budget Basket Mart (BB-Mart), a major retail company seeking to enhance its understanding of sales performance and customer purchasing behaviour to drive business growth and improve customer satisfaction. 
										The task was to analyse customer and sales data to uncover trends, identify key revenue drivers, and evaluate how demographic factors such as age, income, and region influence buying patterns. The tool used for the analysis and visualization was Microsoft Excel, 
										leveraging pivot tables, charts, and slicers to summarize data and create an interactive dashboard. The findings provided insights into sales trends, high-performing product categories, and customer behaviour patterns, helping BB-Mart make informed decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer loyalty initiatives.</p

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Sales performance.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Zico Mart, a leading retail company aiming to understand its sales performance to enhance business growth and customer satisfaction. The task was to analyse customer data to identify sales trends, top-performing product categories, 
										and the influence of demographics such as age, income, and region on buying behaviour. The tool used was Microsoft Excel, utilizing pivot tables, charts, and slicers to build an interactive dashboard that visualized key insights. The findings from the dashboard revealed that higher-income customers and loyal shoppers made more frequent and higher-value purchases, certain product categories particularly electronics and fashion drove the most revenue, and regional 
										differences and promotional offers significantly influenced customer satisfaction and purchase amounts. These insights support strategic decisions in marketing, product stocking, and customer engagement.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Analysis of DermAI Diagnostics Skin Cancer Dataset<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Skin cancer.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The analysis centred on DermAI Diagnostics, a company aiming to improve early detection of skin cancer by analysing real-world clinical data on 1,089 skin lesions 
										and associated patient risk factors. The task was to design and query a structured SQL database combining Patient Info and Lesion Info tables to explore how demographics, environmental exposures, and lesion characteristics
										relate to different diagnostic outcomes. The tool used was SQL, which was applied to import the dataset, define tables, create relationships via joins on patient id, and run analytical queries to summarize trends and segment patients and lesions. The findings from these SQL analyses highlighted meaningful patterns such as correlations between age, skin type, family or personal cancer history, pesticide exposure, and lesion behaviours (growth, colour change, bleeding, 
										elevation) and the likelihood of particular lesion diagnoses thereby supporting more informed biopsy decisions, early detection strategies, and the creation of machine-learning ready data for AI-driven dermatology.</p>
